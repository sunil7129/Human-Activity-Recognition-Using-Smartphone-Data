# Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Smartphone-Data

This repository contains code and resources for a project on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using smartphone data. HAR involves the use of machine learning techniques to classify physical activities based on data collected from the sensors in a smartphone. The dataset used in this project consists of sensor readings from a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone, which includes accelerometer and gyroscope data.
